      Hello Juliette, you probably wont look at this website again, but before I left it I wanted to write one more message to you.
      I hope you know that I am very grateful to have met you. You are a great person and I enjoyed every moment we spent together.
      I know our breakup was hard on both of us, especially because we still love each other, but I now understand it was for the best.
      I want both of us to be happy and work on the things we need, even if that means being apart. I want to get better so I can start
      a healthy relationship in the future with you. I miss you a lot and I think about you every day. I hope you are doing well and taking care of yourself.
      You deserve all the happiness in the world.
      <br><strong>Take care Juliette, I will always love you.</strong>
    </p>

      Hey Juliette, I made this website to express how much I appreciate and love you.
      Every day that I see a message pop up from you my face lights up, and when we call
      I smile the whole time. You are a kind and beautiful human being so you should never
      doubt yourself. I would never try to hurt you or betray you.
      <br><strong>I love you Juliette.</strong>
    </p>
